- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Niranjan Yadav, this is my research related to Network Intrusion Detection System using deep learning.
- This has four files in total as it was difficult to execute all the models one by one in same notebook. During the process either because of the errors or fine tuning  changes.
- All these models took alot of time to execute infact days to execute and needs high computational efficency like here in google colab needed a subscribtion and purchase of compute units further executed on A100 GPU or TPU v2-8 runtime from colab. 
-In this project only DNN were able to execute with 5 folds the other models due to computation effieciency execute with 2 3 and 4 folds you can see it as in the code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science.
